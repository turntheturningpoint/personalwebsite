	<h2>
	High! I'm Angelique Gloria, the youngest daughter of my parents and was 
	<br>born on the 12th of October. I have always been a quite peculiar child. 
	<br>Having different interests is nothing new, of course, but I find that 
	<br>very little people around me have the same interests as I do and those 
	<br>who do are miles away from me and out of reach. I guess I got my head 
	<br>down in a rabbit hole of fantasy and chaotic things, enjoying every 
	<br>moment of it, but who can blame me in indulging in these kind of things? 
	<br>You would've done the same if you wanted to...
	<br>
	<br>I like to make up stories, myths, and epics of how the hero will always 
	<br>fall and the villain triumphant. Observing my surroundings is one of my 
	<br>interest, looking at intricate details and intrigued of how they got there. 
	<br>Coming up with different outcomes and histories of it. Often times, I stare 
	<br>in space for a numerous amount of time and this is where my creative mind 
	<br>usually hits. So I welcome you, to have a look at this exhibition of mine! 
	<br>Be careful to not loose your way...
